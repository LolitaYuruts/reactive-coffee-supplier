# Reactive Coffee supplier

## Introduction

Reactive Coffee supplier is a reactive, non-blocking RESTful web service developed to be used as an API gateway for 
requests for available coffees.

It provides HTTP API and API built on _RSocket_, binary protocol for use on byte stream transports such as TCP, WebSockets,
and Aeron, to eliminate the inter-process communication cons via _"Request - Stream"_ interaction model, that can be 
consumed by other services.
